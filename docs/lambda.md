# Lambda

Lambda is a function that has no name. It is also called anonymous function. It is used when we need a function for a short period of time.

Litteral for function type.

## Method vs Function

Method is a member of a class or object. Function is a value.


```scala
// Method definition

def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y

// Function definition
val add = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y


```
